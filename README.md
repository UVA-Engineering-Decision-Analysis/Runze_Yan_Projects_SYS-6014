# Runze_Yan_Projects_SYS_6014
This project design a system to plan daily activity for people based on human rhythms. The aim of this system is to help people maximize daily benefits, and achieve high productivity in each day. 

In this project, we define three types of internal rhythms which control people's daily performance, they are energy, cognitive, and emotion. And also define the an activity set including sleep, study, exercise, class, and rest. Decision makers need to select one type of activities from the activity set. The rewards correspond to different decisions at different time of the day is also different. The whole problem is solved within the Markov Decsion Process (MDP). And we achieved three policies, and compared their performance based on the inmmediate rewards.

The main program of this project is the mdp.ipynb
